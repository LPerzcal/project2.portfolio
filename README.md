### **Project Overview**:
  The Marketing department is looking to optimize their email campaigns to increase the click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CR) for their partner offers. 
  They are conducting an A/B test where one group of subscribers (Type A) receives the current email campaign, while another group (Type B) receives a new variation 
  of the email with different content and layout.
  
  As Senior Data Analyst my responsibility was to monitor the email campaign performance post-implementation and provide regular reports (**in Tableau**) to track the ongoing impact of the changes.

**1. Objective Definition:** 
Collaborate with the marketing team to establish clear objectives for the A/B test. The primary goal was to assess whether the new email campaign (**Type B**) 
outperforms the existing one (**Type A**) in terms of CTR and conversion rates.

**2. Data Retrieval (Databicks/SparkSQL):** Gather historical data ensuring that email engagement data, conversion data, and other relevant metrics are properly tracked and segmented for **both Types**.

**3. Data Preprocessing (Databricks/PySpark):** Working with Data Engineers to clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Calculate derived metrics, such as **CTR** and **CR**.

**4. A/B Test Setup (Python):** Working with Data Scientist to split the dataset into two groups: one for users exposed to **Type A** and the other for users exposed to **Type B**. Conduct statistical tests (e.g., t-test or chi-squared test) 
to assess whether any observed differences in **CTR** and **CR** are statistically significant.

**5. Data Visualization (Tableau):** Create interactive dashboards in **Tableau** to visualize key metrics and test results using visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to illustrate 
the performance of Type A and Type B.

**6. Data Automation (Databricks):** Set up data pipelines and automation processes in Databricks to streamline data extraction, preprocessing, and analysis for future A/B tests.

**7. Reporting and Insights (Tableau):** Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the data analysis to optimize future ad campaigns.
