### **Project Overview**:
The Marketing department is looking to optimize their email campaigns to increase the click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates for their partner offers. 
They are conducting an A/B test where one group of subscribers (Group A) receives the current email campaign, while another group (Group B) receives a new variation 
of the email with different content and layout.

**1. Objective Definition:** 
Collaboration with the marketing team to establish clear objectives for the A/B test. The primary goal is to assess whether the new email campaign (Type B) outperforms the existing one (Type A) 
in terms of CTR and conversion rates.

**2. Hypothesis Development::** Work with affiliate marketing team leaders to formulate hypotheses related to the changes in the email campaign. For example, "We hypothesize that the new email 
content in Type B will lead to a higher CTR compared to the existing content in Type A."

**3. Data Retrieval (Databicks/SparkSQL):** Query our main database to retrieve relevant data, including user interactions with the ads (impressions, clicks), conversion data, and information 
about the affiliate links associated with each Type.

**4. Data Preprocessing (Databricks/PySpark):** Working with Data Engineers to clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Calculate derived metrics, such as CTR (clicks/impressions) and conversion rate (conversions/clicks)

**5. A/B Test Setup (Python):** Split the dataset into two groups: one for users exposed to Ad A and the other for users exposed to Ad B. Conduct statistical tests (e.g., t-test or chi-squared test) 
to assess whether any observed differences in CTR and conversion rates are statistically significant.

**6. Data Visualization (Tableau):** Create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize key metrics and test results using visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to illustrate 
the performance of Type A and Type B.

**7. Data Automation (Databricks):** Set up data pipelines and automation processes in Databricks to streamline data extraction, preprocessing, and analysis for future A/B tests.

**8. Reporting and Insights (Tableau):** Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the data analysis to optimize future ad campaigns.
